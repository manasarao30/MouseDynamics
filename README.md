# MouseDynamics

<aside>
Objective & Significance**

The objective of this project is to design an advanced user authentication system using mouse dynamics as a behavioral biometric. By analyzing unique patterns in mouse movements, such as velocity and angles, the system enhances security while offering a seamless, user-friendly experience. This approach adds an extra layer of authentication that is both passive and non-intrusive. Behavioral biometrics provide a significant advantage in combating identity theft and fraudulent access, as they are difficult to replicate or steal compared to traditional credentials like passwords or tokens.
